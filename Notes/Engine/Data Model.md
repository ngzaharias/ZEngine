Standardize data model and separate read/write
- automate undo, copy/paste
- automate uis for property/tree/graph view
- all data has a "version" 
	- thread safe since each thread make their own version of the object
- write creates a new copy of the object for modification
- commit atomically switches anyone looking at the old copy for the new version
	- calculates the delta, could be networked for real-time collaboration
- readers can read the data without locking
- objects referencing other objects do so via id (guid?)
	- hard links = guids
	- symbolic links = paths
